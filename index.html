Instead of treating performance as a single numeric outcome, we emphasize comparative trends across training configurations and particle classes to better understand how model decisions emerge.

      <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"></div>

      <p>
        This task focuses on optimizing a deep learning model for classifying protein particles into ten categories (mAb1–mAb10) by analyzing approximately 15 experimental sets with varying normalization and transformation protocols. To address the inherent challenge of high inter-class similarity, the dataset was rigorously partitioned and trained using dynamic augmentations to ensure robust feature extraction and generalization. Performance is evaluated through macro-averaged F1-score, precision, and recall, while heatmaps are utilized to visually confirm that the model identifies the correct morphological characteristics for classification.

        Optimization of Model Configuration for Protein Particle Classification
      </h4>

      <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"></div>

      <p>
        To identify an effective configuration for protein particle classification,
        we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of approximately fifteen distinct experimental setups.
        Each setup was carefully designed by varying image normalization strategies,
        transformation pipelines, and training configurations in order to isolate
        the impact of individual design choices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than relying solely on global performance averages,
        the selection process was guided by a holistic analysis of class-wise behavior.
        Classification performance was examined independently for each antibody class
        (mAb1 through mAb10), allowing us to compare relative trends in confidence,
        stability, and consistency across configurations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most effective configuration demonstrated consistently strong behavior
        across all major evaluation criteria.
        This outcome is particularly notable given the intrinsic inter-class similarity
        of protein particles.
        The success of this configuration is primarily attributed to a training strategy
        that emphasized spatial diversity through variations in image size and orientation.
      </p>

      <p>
        By exposing the model to these controlled spatial transformations,
        the training process encouraged the development of more generalized feature representations,
        enabling reliable classification across diverse particle morphologies.
        The resulting focus of the model is further illustrated through qualitative visualization,
        such as class-wise heatmaps.

    <div class="content has-text-justified readable-content">
      <h4 class="title is-5">Key Observations from Model Evaluation</h4>

      <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"></div>

      <p>
        Analysis of the best-performing configuration revealed a consistent hierarchy
        in class-level behavior.
        Certain antibody classes demonstrated comparatively stronger and more stable responses,
        while others repeatedly exhibited weaker performance trends.
        This pattern was observed not only in the optimal configuration,
        but also as a general tendency across the majority of experimental setups.
      </p>

      <p>
        These observations suggest that model difficulty is not uniformly distributed across classes.
        Instead, specific antibody categories present persistent challenges that are
        resistant to changes in training configuration.
        Such consistency highlights the importance of class-aware analysis
        when evaluating model behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effectiveness of the strongest configuration can be largely attributed
        to its preprocessing pipeline, which combined random resizing,
        background unification, and orientation perturbations.
        These factors appear to play a decisive role in guiding the model
        toward learning discriminative and transferable visual features.
