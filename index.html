      <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"></div>

      <p>
        This task focuses on optimizing a deep learning model for classifying protein particles into ten categories (mAb1–mAb10) by analyzing approximately 15 experimental sets with varying normalization and transformation protocols. To address the inherent challenge of high inter-class similarity, the dataset was rigorously partitioned and trained using dynamic augmentations to ensure robust feature extraction and generalization. Performance is evaluated through macro-averaged F1-score, precision, and recall, while heatmaps are utilized to visually confirm that the model identifies the correct morphological characteristics for classification.

        Optimization of Model Configuration for Protein Particle Classification
      </h4>

      <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"></div>

      <p>
        To identify an effective configuration for protein particle classification,
        we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of approximately fifteen distinct experimental setups.
        Each setup was carefully designed by varying image normalization strategies,
        transformation pipelines, and training configurations in order to isolate
        the impact of individual design choices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than relying solely on global performance averages,
        the selection process was guided by a holistic analysis of class-wise behavior.
        Classification performance was examined independently for each antibody class
        (mAb1 through mAb10), allowing us to compare relative trends in confidence,
        stability, and consistency across configurations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most effective configuration demonstrated consistently strong behavior
        across all major evaluation criteria.
        This outcome is particularly notable given the intrinsic inter-class similarity
        of protein particles.
        The success of this configuration is primarily attributed to a training strategy
        that emphasized spatial diversity through variations in image size and orientation.
      </p>

      <p>
        By exposing the model to these controlled spatial transformations,
        the training process encouraged the development of more generalized feature representations,
        enabling reliable classification across diverse particle morphologies.
        The resulting focus of the model is further illustrated through qualitative visualization,
        such as class-wise heatmaps.

    <div class="content has-text-justified readable-content">
      <h4 class="title is-5">Key Observations from Model Evaluation</h4>

      <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"></div>

      <p>
        Analysis of the best-performing configuration revealed a consistent hierarchy
        in class-level behavior.
        Certain antibody classes demonstrated comparatively stronger and more stable responses,
        while others repeatedly exhibited weaker performance trends.
        This pattern was observed not only in the optimal configuration,
        but also as a general tendency across the majority of experimental setups.
      </p>

      <p>
        These observations suggest that model difficulty is not uniformly distributed across classes.
        Instead, specific antibody categories present persistent challenges that are
        resistant to changes in training configuration.
        Such consistency highlights the importance of class-aware analysis
        when evaluating model behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effectiveness of the strongest configuration can be largely attributed
        to its preprocessing pipeline, which combined random resizing,
        background unification, and orientation perturbations.
        These factors appear to play a decisive role in guiding the model
        toward learning discriminative and transferable visual features.

  <h5 class="title is-5">1. Augmentation Sensitivity-Robustness Profiling</h5>
  <p>
    We evaluated classification stability across 10 mAb categories using seven image transformations.
    The <strong>Net Score</strong> (Fig. B1) quantifies this stability: positive values indicate robustness (insensitivity),
    while negative values indicate sensitivity to specific factors.
    Notably, the Top 3 robust classes (<strong>mAb1, mAb3, mAb5</strong>) achieved an average True Positive Rate (Recall) of <strong>0.83</strong>,
    proving that the model extracts highly reliable features even under varied perturbations.

  <h5 class="title is-5">2. Particle Insights</h5>
  <p>
    Based on the Net Scores and sensitivity patterns, we categorized the particles to infer their physical characteristics:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Group 1: Shape-Dominant (Robust)</strong><br>
      <strong>mAb3</strong> (Net +6) and <strong>mAb5</strong> (Net +2) are the most stable, maintaining identity regardless of visual changes.
      This suggests a "shape-dominant" population with rigid morphological signatures where the structural outline serves as the primary,
      noise-immune classification cue.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <strong>Group 2: Texture-Sensitive</strong><br>
      <strong>mAb1</strong> (Net +1) is robust against Sharpness and Background shifts but sensitive to Luminance.
      While its outer boundary is clear, the model relies heavily on internal optical density (contrast) for identification,
      indicating that internal texture is as vital as global shape.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <strong>Group 3: Context &amp; Scale Dependent</strong><br>
      <strong>mAb7</strong> (Net -1), <strong>mAb8</strong> (Net -2), and <strong>mAb10</strong> (Net -2) exhibit "Directional and Scale dependency."
      Sensitivity to Flip and Size suggests the model uses orientation or specific size distributions as shortcuts,
      implying a lack of scale/rotation-invariant features.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <strong>Group 4: Heterogeneous &amp; Fragile (Sensitive)</strong><br>
      <strong>mAb4</strong> (Net -6), <strong>mAb6</strong> (Net -5), and <strong>mAb9</strong> (Net -5) show extreme vulnerability across nearly all factors.
      This indicates high heterogeneity; these particles lack defining structural features and likely represent unstable aggregates with irregular boundaries
      and diverse internal patterns.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div style="margin-top: 2.0rem;"></div>

  <h5 class="title is-5">3. Conclusion</h5>
  <p>
    The analysis reveals that while the model achieves high reliability for particles with distinct morphological "fingerprints"
    (<strong>mAb1, 3, 5</strong>), it remains vulnerable to Flip and Luminance transformations in less distinct categories.
    This systematic profiling serves as a framework for identifying which physical attributes—shape, texture, or scale—are most critical
    for automated FIM-based protein aggregate identification.
